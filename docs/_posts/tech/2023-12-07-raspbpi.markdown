## Introduction

Raspberry Pi, the versatile and affordable single-board computer, has become a favorite among DIY enthusiasts and developers. In this blog post, we'll guide you through the process of setting up your Raspberry Pi, installing the Raspberry Pi OS, and culminating in a hands-on project to control an LED using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Download Raspberry Pi OS

Begin by visiting the [Raspberry Pi Software](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) page. Download the Raspberry Pi Imager.

### 2. Install Raspberry Pi OS

- Insert your microSD card into the computer.
- Run the Raspberry Pi Imager and select Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit).
- Set storage options and enable SSH.
- Set a username and password.
- Click "WRITE" to transfer the OS to the microSD card.

### 3. Initial Setup on Raspberry Pi

- Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it on.
- Set your Country, Language, and Timezone.
- Create a user account and connect to a WiFi network.
- Choose a browser and update software.

### 4. Installing Python Libraries

Open a terminal and run the following commands to install essential Python libraries:

```bash
sudo su
apt-get update
apt-get install python3-matplotlib
apt-get install python3-scipy
exit
```

### 5. Configuring a Jupyter Notebook

To avoid the "externally-managed-environment" error, follow the steps outlined in the [Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/os.html#python-on-raspberry-pi).

```bash
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
python -m venv env
#or python -m venv --system-site-packages env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install jupyter
deactivate
reboot
```

```bash
cd my_project
source env/bin/activate
jupyter notebook
#note the generated token
```



### 6. Network and Browswer Configuration

#### 1. Retrieve Hostname and IP Address:

To discover the IP address of your machine, use the following command:

```bash
hostname -I
```

This command returns the IP address associated with your hostname.

#### 2. View Routing Information:

To examine the routing information for your system, use the `ip` command:

```bash
ip r
```

This displays the routing table, providing insights into how network packets are directed.

#### 3. Check DNS Configuration:

To identify the nameserver configuration and check DNS settings, execute:

```bash
grep "nameserver" /etc/resolv.conf
```

This command extracts lines containing "nameserver" from the resolv.conf file, revealing DNS server details.

#### 4. Explore Operating System Information:

To gather information about your operating system, use the following command:

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```

This command outputs details like the OS name, version, and other relevant information stored in the os-release file.

These commands provide a quick overview of your system's network configuration and operating system details, aiding in troubleshooting and system understanding.

#### 5. Improve browsing experience by setting a browser as the default:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser
sudo reboot
```

### 7. SSH Connection and Jupyter Notebook

- Open PuTTY and enter the Raspberry Pi's IP address.
- Navigate to Connection -> SSH -> Tunnels. Set Source port to 8888 and Destination to localhost:8888.
- Save the session and open the connection.
- Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8888/. Enter the generated token.

### 8. LED Control Project

Now, let's delve into a simple LED control project.

#### Hardware Setup

1. Insert an LED into the breadboard.
2. Connect the cathode of the LED to a resistor and GPIO pin 6 on the Raspberry Pi.
3. Connect the anode of the LED to a ground (GND) pin on the Raspberry Pi.

#### Software Setup (In Jupyter Notebook)

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(6, GPIO.OUT)

while True:
    GPIO.output(6, GPIO.HIGH)
    time.sleep(15)
    GPIO.output(6, GPIO.LOW)
    time.sleep(10)
```

This simple Python script turns on the LED for 15 seconds and then turns it off for 10 seconds in an infinite loop.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up your Raspberry Pi, configured a Jupyter Notebook, and even embarked on a basic hardware project. The possibilities with Raspberry Pi are endless, and this blog serves as a stepping stone for more exciting ventures into the world of DIY electronics and programming. Explore further, experiment, and enjoy your Raspberry Pi journey!
