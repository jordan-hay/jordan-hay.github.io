Facial recognition and landmark detection have become central to many applications ranging from biometric authentication to augmented reality. In this tutorial, we walk through a practical workflow using Pythonâ€™s **`face_recognition`**, **Pillow**, and **Shapely** libraries to detect faces, extract facial landmarks, and analyze geometric structures of facial features.

We also generate random synthetic faces for demonstration using the `thispersondoesnotexist.com` service.

## Installing Dependencies

To start, install the `face_recognition` library. If you have GPU support, it speeds up computations:

```python
!pip install face_recognition >&/dev/null  #gpu
```

We also use several standard libraries for image handling, visualization, and geometric analysis:

```python
import requests
import face_recognition
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from shapely.geometry import Polygon, LineString
```

---

## Downloading Random Faces

We fetch three synthetic faces for our demonstration:

```python
# Download 3 random faces
image_paths = ["/content/frontal1.jpg", "/content/frontal2.jpg", "/content/frontal3.jpg"]
for path in image_paths:
    resp = requests.get("https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/")
    if resp.status_code == 200:
        with open(path, "wb") as f:
            f.write(resp.content)
```

## Visualizing Faces, Face Boxes, and Facial Landmarks

We create a 3x3 plot to visualize each image in three ways: plain image, face bounding boxes, and landmark connections.

```python
# Prepare 3x3 plot
fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 3, figsize=(15, 15))

for col, path in enumerate(image_paths):
    # Load image
    image = face_recognition.load_image_file(path)
    pil_image = Image.fromarray(image)

    # --- Top row: plain image ---
    axs[0, col].imshow(pil_image)
    axs[0, col].axis('off')
    axs[0, col].set_title(f"Plain\n{path.split('/')[-1]}")

    # --- Middle row: face boxes ---
    img_box = pil_image.copy()
    draw_box = ImageDraw.Draw(img_box)
    face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)
    for (top, right, bottom, left) in face_locations:
        draw_box.rectangle(((left, top), (right, bottom)), outline="red", width=3)
    axs[1, col].imshow(img_box)
    axs[1, col].axis('off')
    axs[1, col].set_title("Face Box")

    # --- Bottom row: facial features landmarks ---
    img_landmarks = pil_image.copy()
    draw_landmarks = ImageDraw.Draw(img_landmarks)
    landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)
    for landmarks in landmarks_list:
        for feature, points in landmarks.items():
            # Draw lines connecting landmark points
            draw_landmarks.line(points + [points[0]], fill='cyan', width=2)
    axs[2, col].imshow(img_landmarks)
    axs[2, col].axis('off')
    axs[2, col].set_title("Facial Features")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Advanced Visualization with Shapely Mesh

For geometric analysis, we can represent facial landmarks as **LineStrings** or **Polygons** using Shapely. This allows us to visualize a mesh structure for each face:

```python
from shapely.geometry import LineString, Polygon
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Prepare 4x3 plot (4 rows: plain, boxes, landmarks, mesh)
fig, axs = plt.subplots(4, 3, figsize=(15, 20))

for col, path in enumerate(image_paths):
    # Load image
    image = face_recognition.load_image_file(path)
    pil_image = Image.fromarray(image)

    # --- Top row: plain image ---
    axs[0, col].imshow(pil_image)
    axs[0, col].axis('off')
    axs[0, col].set_title(f"Plain\n{path.split('/')[-1]}")

    # --- 2nd row: face boxes ---
    img_box = pil_image.copy()
    draw_box = ImageDraw.Draw(img_box)
    face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)
    for (top, right, bottom, left) in face_locations:
        draw_box.rectangle(((left, top), (right, bottom)), outline="red", width=3)
    axs[1, col].imshow(img_box)
    axs[1, col].axis('off')
    axs[1, col].set_title("Face Box")

    # --- 3rd row: facial landmarks ---
    img_landmarks = pil_image.copy()
    draw_landmarks = ImageDraw.Draw(img_landmarks)
    landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)
    for landmarks in landmarks_list:
        for feature, points in landmarks.items():
            draw_landmarks.line(points + [points[0]], fill='cyan', width=2)
    axs[2, col].imshow(img_landmarks)
    axs[2, col].axis('off')
    axs[2, col].set_title("Facial Features")

    # --- 4th row: mesh from Shapely geometries ---
    axs[3, col].set_title("Mesh / Shape")
    axs[3, col].axis('off')
    
    # Example: draw each feature from landmarks as LineStrings
    for landmarks in landmarks_list:
        for feature, points in landmarks.items():
            line = LineString(points)
            x, y = line.xy
            axs[3, col].plot(x, y, marker='o')
    axs[3, col].invert_yaxis()  # optional: match image coordinates

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Creating a DataFrame of Geometric Features

We can systematically store each feature as a geometric object in a **pandas DataFrame**:

```python
# Initialize list for rows
data = []

# Process each image and extract geometric shapes
for img_idx, path in enumerate(image_paths):
    image = face_recognition.load_image_file(path)
    landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)

    for face_idx, landmarks in enumerate(landmarks_list):
        for feature, points in landmarks.items():
            # Decide if shape should be a closed Polygon or open LineString
            if feature in ['top_lip', 'bottom_lip', 'left_eye', 'right_eye', 'nose_tip']:
                shape = Polygon(points)
            else:
                shape = LineString(points)

            data.append({
                'image': path.split('/')[-1],
                'face_index': face_idx,
                'feature': feature,
                'geometry': shape
            })

# Create DataFrame
df_shapes = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Optional: display the DataFrame
df_shapes
```

This structure makes it easy to query specific features or images, for example:

```python
df_shapes[
(df_shapes["image"] == "frontal1.jpg") & (df_shapes["feature"] == "top_lip")
]["geometry"].values[0]
```

## Visualizing Individual Features

Shapely geometries allow easy plotting of specific facial features:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from shapely.geometry import LineString, Polygon

# Example: features_and_geometry has 'feature' and 'geometry' columns
for feature, geom in zip(features_and_geometry['feature'], features_and_geometry['geometry']):
    plt.figure(figsize=(4, 1))
    
    # Shapely: get coordinates for plotting
    if isinstance(geom, LineString):
        x, y = geom.xy
    elif isinstance(geom, Polygon):
        x, y = geom.exterior.xy
    else:
        continue  # skip unsupported types
    
    plt.plot(x, y, marker='o')
    plt.title(feature)
    plt.axis('equal')
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()
```

## Summary

In this blog, we demonstrated:

* Fetching synthetic faces for testing.
* Detecting faces and facial landmarks using **`face_recognition`**.
* Visualizing faces, bounding boxes, landmarks, and geometric meshes.
* Structuring facial feature geometry in a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
* Leveraging **Shapely** to represent features as **LineStrings** or **Polygons**, enabling geometric computations and plotting.

This workflow provides a robust foundation for facial analysis, feature-based machine learning, or advanced AR/VR applications.
