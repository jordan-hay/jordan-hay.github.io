I hold a Ph.D. from Cornell University and Bachelors of Science from University of California, Davis. With academia, industry, and government work experience, I serve clients in the areas of data science, computational science, biochemistry, biological sciences/engineering (AP Biology, USABO), business analytics, optimization modeling, simulation, accounting and finance. I also make [EdTech videos](https://www.youtube.com/@Biology101LearningCenter).
