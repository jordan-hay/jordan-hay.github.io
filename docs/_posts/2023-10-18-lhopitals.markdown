## Introduction

In the world of calculus, there are instances where mathematical problems seem to defy straightforward solutions. One such conundrum arises when you encounter a limit of a quotient where both the numerator and denominator approach zero as a variable, in this case, h, gets infinitely small. To tackle this issue, mathematicians have devised a powerful tool known as L'Hopital's Rule. In this blog, we will dive into the mechanics of this rule, but first, let's examine the problem that necessitates its application.

## The Limit

Consider the following limit:

$$ \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{\tan(2(x + h)) - \tan(2x)}{h} $$

This expression is intriguing because, as h approaches zero, both the numerator and the denominator also approach zero. When we encounter such an indeterminate form (0/0), it leaves us scratching our heads. How can we make sense of this seemingly impossible situation?

## Understanding the Numerator
Let's delve into the numerator to gain a better understanding of this limit. The numerator can be expressed as:

\$$\tan(2(x + h)) - \tan(2x) $$

This expression involves the subtraction of two tangent functions. One of these functions pertains to the quantity $$2(x + h)$$, while the other corresponds to $$2x$$. When we scrutinize the behavior of this difference as $$h$$ approaches zero, we observe a fascinating phenomenon.

As $$h$$ diminishes to infinitesimal levels, the angles inside the tangent functions draw nearer to each other. This convergence leads to a difference that can be precisely calculated. In essence, as $$h$$ tends towards zero, the limit of this expression indeed evaluates to zero. Consequently, the numerator converges to zero as $$h$$ approaches zero.
## Understanding the Denominator

Next, let's analyze the behavior of the denominator:

$$ h $$

The denominator, on the other hand, is quite straightforward. It's simply h, and as h approaches zero, the denominator indeed becomes zero.

## Introducing L'Hopital's Rule

Now, we find ourselves in a situation where the numerator doesn't vanish as h approaches zero, while the denominator does. This is where L'Hopital's Rule comes to our rescue. Named after the French mathematician Guillaume de l'Hopital, this rule offers a method for evaluating indeterminate limits of the form 0/0 and $$\infty/\infty$$.

L'Hopital's Rule states that if the limit of a ratio (0/0 or $$\infty/\infty$$) exists, it is equal to the limit of the ratio of the derivatives of the numerator and denominator:

$$ \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{g(x + h) - g(x)} = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} $$

### Calculating the Derivatives

Now, let's calculate the derivatives of the numerator and denominator.

For the numerator, which is $$\tan(2(x + h)) - \tan(2x)$$, we need to find the derivative with respect to h. The derivative of $$\tan(2(x + h))$$ is $$\sec^2(2(x + h)) \cdot 2$$, and the derivative of $$\tan(2x)$$ is $$\sec^2(2x) \cdot 0$$ because it's a constant with respect to h. So, the derivative of the numerator is:

$$ 2\sec^2(2(x + h)) $$

For the denominator, which is simply $$h$$, its derivative with respect to h is:

$$ 1 $$

Now, we can apply L'Hopital's Rule to our original limit:

$$ \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{\tan(2(x + h)) - \tan(2x)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{2\sec^2(2(x + h))}{1} $$

As h approaches zero, the limit becomes:

$$ 2\sec^2(2x) $$

## Conclusion

By applying L'Hopital's Rule and correctly calculating the derivatives of the numerator and denominator, we've successfully evaluated the initially perplexing limit. It simplifies to $$2\sec^2(2x)$$, giving us a clear and non-indeterminate result. L'Hopital's Rule is a valuable tool in solving limits with indeterminate forms, and mastering it can unlock the solutions to complex problems in calculus.
