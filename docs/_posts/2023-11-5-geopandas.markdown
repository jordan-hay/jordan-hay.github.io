### Introduction

In today's data-driven world, powerful tools help uncover insights hidden within geographic data. With the assistance of Python and Geopandas, flood vulnerabilities in New York City become visible. The journey begins with data collection, followed by a deep dive into neighborhoods and flood-prone areas. This guide walks through the code step by step, ensuring an understanding of how Geopandas and Python predict flood risks and visualize their impact on different parts of the city.

<br>
The data resource accessible at [NYC Stormwater Flood Map - Extreme Flood with 2080 Sea Level Rise](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Stormwater-Flood-Map-Extreme-Flood-with-2080-S/w8eg-8ha6){:target="_blank"} is a valuable dataset made available by the City of New York. It contains comprehensive information related to stormwater flood mapping, with a specific focus on projecting extreme flood scenarios considering sea level rise until the year 2080. This dataset is instrumental in understanding and mitigating the potential impacts of climate change, as it provides detailed insights into various flood categories:
 
<br> 
1. **Nuisance Flooding (greater or equal to 4 in. and less than 1 ft.):** This category addresses minor yet recurrent flooding, characterized by water levels ranging from 4 inches to less than 1 foot above normal tide levels.

2. **Deep and Contiguous Flooding (1 ft. and greater):** This segment highlights more severe and continuous flooding, with water levels reaching 1 foot or higher. Such extensive flooding has the potential to significantly affect both urban infrastructure and natural surroundings.

3. **Future High Tides 2080:** This section of the dataset provides projections for high tide levels expected in the year 2080. It offers crucial insights into how sea level rise may affect New York City's coastline in the future.

The ["Community Health Survey GIS Data"](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/maps-gis-data-files-for-download.page){:target="_blank"}  is a valuable resource made available by the New York City Department of Health (NYC DOH). This dataset comprises shapefiles that are used to represent aggregated city-wide health statistics across various neighborhoods defined by the United Hospital Fund.

### Conclusion
The use of Geopandas and Python in this New York City flood vulnerability analysis has unveiled precise insights into the city's resilience against sea level rise and extreme weather events. These tools have efficiently dissected data to show the vulnerabilities of specific neighborhoods, ranging from minor inundations to profound flooding.
